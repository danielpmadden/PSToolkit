# Project Audit & Roadmap Report

## 1. Executive Summary
PSToolkit is a single PowerShell script intended to provide menu-driven diagnostics and maintenance on Windows workstations, supported by textual logging and JSON exports.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L1-L276】 The codebase is an early-stage prototype: functionality is mostly interactive, documentation overpromises automation and configuration hooks that are not implemented, and there is no testing or deployment automation. Overall production readiness is **35/100**. Strengths include a clear operator-oriented menu flow, consistent logging scaffolding, and administrator checks that prevent privileged routines from running without elevation.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L36-L233】 Weaknesses are the absence of parameterized/automated execution paths, missing tests and CI, and fragile error handling with little input validation.

## 2. Codebase Integrity
- The script uses `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` without wrapping high-risk calls in `try/catch`, so any transient command failure will terminate the session abruptly.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L8-L233】
- Functions mix user interaction, command invocation, and file output, leading to large switch blocks with limited modular reuse (e.g., menu handlers of 30+ lines each).【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L88-L233】
- JSON export routines dump raw command output, resulting in arrays of unstructured strings instead of typed objects, limiting machine-readability.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L45-L116】
- `Remove-Item` deletes the entire `%TEMP%` tree without dry-run safeguards and counts files beforehand, which can be expensive on large directories and fail mid-run.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L212-L216】
- No comments/docstrings describe expected return objects or error semantics beyond menu headings; maintenance actions lack validation for user-supplied drive letters and ping targets.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L105-L233】
- Documentation advertises CLI flags (`-Action`, `-ExportJson`, etc.) that are absent from the script, indicating dead or missing code paths.【F:README.md†L118-L127】

## 3. Dependency & Build Health
- Core dependencies are built-in Windows/PowerShell commands (`ipconfig`, `Test-Connection`, `Get-EventLog`, `Get-CimInstance`, `cleanmgr.exe`, `defrag`).【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L97-L232】
- No PowerShell module manifest, package descriptor, or lock file exists; reproducibility relies entirely on the host OS.
- README references optional PSWindowsUpdate integration, but the module is not bundled or checked, resulting in a warning-only stub.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L218-L222】
- No automated build or dependency verification scripts are present.

## 4. Architecture & Design
- Architecture is a monolithic PowerShell script with imperative menus and no separation between UI, business logic, and persistence.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L88-L276】
- Configuration handling described in the README (`config.json`, `config.local.json`) is not implemented, and all paths are hard-coded relative to the script root.【F:README.md†L172-L191】【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L14-L233】
- There is no modularization (e.g., PowerShell module with exported functions) to support reuse or testing.
- Logging is file-based with directories auto-created at start-up, but lacks rotation or size checks beyond directory creation.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L10-L30】
- No circular imports exist, but tight coupling to user input and console rendering blocks headless or remote automation.

## 5. Security Audit
- Script correctly enforces elevation before running privileged tasks via `Ensure-Administrator`.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L75-L240】
- However, it accepts unsanitized user input for ping targets and defrag drive letters, which could be abused to pass arbitrary arguments to external executables (`Test-Connection`, `defrag`).【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L105-L233】
- Clearing the entire temp directory and running `cleanmgr.exe`/`defrag` are powerful actions without confirmation or scope checks.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L205-L233】
- No authentication/authorization logic exists for remote usage; assumed to run locally.
- No secret management issues observed (no hardcoded credentials).
- Security posture score: **40/100** due to input validation gaps and lack of logging hardening.

## 6. Testing & QA
- No automated tests, Pester scripts, or coverage reports exist in the repo; README instructions are aspirational only.【F:README.md†L206-L225】
- No CI pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions, etc.) is present.
- Manual testing is implied via interactive usage; high risk of regressions.
- Roadmap should prioritize building a Pester harness around each function and adding linting (PSScriptAnalyzer) to reach ≥80% coverage.

## 7. Documentation & Onboarding
- README is extensive but diverges from reality: advertised CLI flags, transcript rotation, and JSON schema do not exist in code.【F:README.md†L90-L160】【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L45-L276】
- No quickstart for contributors, no CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG, and no architecture diagram explaining data flow.
- Lack of module manifest or install instructions for dependencies (e.g., PSWindowsUpdate) may confuse new users.
- Need inline comments describing return values and error behavior for maintenance actions.

## 8. Performance & Scalability
- Commands like `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` over `%TEMP%` and `Get-EventLog` for newest 10 entries run synchronously and may hang on large directories or event logs.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L144-L216】
- No concurrency or background jobs; all operations are blocking.
- JSON export uses `ConvertTo-Json` with depth 5, but streaming large outputs (e.g., `systeminfo`) can produce large files; no compression or pagination.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L45-L141】
- Tool is intended for single-host diagnostics; scaling to fleets would require remoting/orchestration not present.

## 9. DevOps & Deployment
- No Dockerfile, packaging script, or release automation. Distribution relies on manual cloning.
- README references releases and automation that are absent.【F:README.md†L47-L58】
- No `.psd1` manifest or PowerShell Gallery packaging for versioning.
- No CI/CD pipeline, artifact publishing, or rollback strategy.

## 10. Maintainability & Team Ergonomics
- Single script file complicates ownership and changes; no module boundaries or tests to guide refactoring.【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L1-L276】
- Lack of parameterization prevents automation and encourages copy/paste modifications.
- Git history cannot be assessed here, but repository lacks issue/PR templates and contribution guidelines.
- High bus factor: knowledge concentrated in one script author.

## 11. Strategic Roadmap
| Phase | Objective | Key Actions | Deliverables | Priority |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Stabilization | Implement parameter parsing, add input validation, wrap risky commands with error handling, and align README claims with actual behavior. Introduce logging safeguards. | Interactive script that matches documentation and fails gracefully. | 🔴 High |
| Phase 2 | Modernization | Refactor into a PowerShell module with exported functions, create configuration loader, and structure outputs (PSCustomObjects). Set up PSScriptAnalyzer linting. | `PSToolkit` module with reusable cmdlets and structured JSON. | 🟠 Medium |
| Phase 3 | Security Hardening | Add input sanitization, confirmation prompts for destructive actions, integrate secret scanning and establish execution policy guidance. | Documented security baseline and automated scans. | 🟢 Medium |
| Phase 4 | Observability | Add transcript control, telemetry hooks, and structured logging (JSON log entries, log rotation). | Centralized, machine-readable observability outputs. | 🟢 Medium |
| Phase 5 | Scaling & UX | Implement non-interactive automation mode, remote session orchestration, and packaging (PowerShell Gallery, release pipelines). Optimize long-running tasks with async jobs or batching. | Production-grade release v1.0 with automation support. | 🟢 Low |

**Estimated timeline:** Phase 1 (2–3 weeks) → Phase 2 (3–4 weeks, depends on Phase 1 refactors) → Phase 3 (2 weeks, dependent on refactored module) → Phase 4 (2 weeks, depends on Phase 2 logging refactor) → Phase 5 (4+ weeks, requires completion of previous phases).

## 12. Risk Matrix
| Severity | Description | Affected Area | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Critical | Unvalidated user input passed to external commands | Maintenance & diagnostics actions | Sanitize/whitelist inputs, add confirmation, handle command failures. |
| High | Documentation promises unsupported CLI automation | User expectations & support | Implement parameters or correct docs to avoid misuse. |
| Medium | Lack of automated testing/CI | Quality assurance | Add Pester suite and CI pipeline. |
| Low | Monolithic script structure | Code organization | Refactor into module with layered design. |

## 13. Recommendations Summary

7. Package toolkit as a PowerShell module with manifest, versioning, and dependency checks (long-term improvement).【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L1-L276】
8. Implement configuration loader (JSON merging) as described in docs to support environment-specific defaults (long-term).【F:README.md†L172-L191】
9. Add logging safeguards—size limits, rotation, configurable paths—to prevent disk exhaustion (long-term).【F:PSToolkit.ps1†L10-L52】
10. Establish security scanning (e.g., GitHub secret scanning, Defender for DevOps) and document operational runbooks (long-term).

> **Overall Recommendation:**  
> Current state: **Prototype**  
> Next milestone: Target **v0.5** within ~3 months after completing Phases 1–2 to deliver a test-covered, module-based release suitable for pilot deployments.
