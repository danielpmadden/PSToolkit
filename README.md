- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later
- **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or higher
- **Permissions**: Administrator privileges are required

## Installation

1. Download the script.
2. Copy the script to the target machine (for example: `C:\SupportTools\`).
3. (Optional) Review or customize the script before use.

## Usage

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
2. If needed, temporarily bypass the execution policy: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
3. Run the script: ./PSToolkit.ps1
4. Follow the on-screen menu to select and run support tasks.

## Logs

Every action is automatically logged in a timestamped .txt file. The script automatically creates an `Outputs` folder alongside the script on first run. Log files are stored in `Outputs/Logs` and JSON data exports are written to `Outputs/Json`.
